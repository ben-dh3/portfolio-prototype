# Portfolio For Coding Projects Made Using Three.js

Inspired by a design by [Richard Mattka](https://richardmattka.com/), my goal was to create a visually stunning portfolio to house my coding projects. 

Made using Javascript, React, Three.js, GSAP, Framer Motion.

During the process of making the 3D visual effects, I spent time building with Blender and importing a model from Blender into Three.js. Ultimately I found the best way to achieve my intended effect was to create a Three.js geometry and use an event listener to make it move and respond to the users mouse movement.

In the future I intend to explore GLSL integration with Three.js and make more sophisticated visual effects.
